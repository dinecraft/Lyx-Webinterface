# OpenHCP - Open Hosting Control Platform

OpenHCP is an open Source project which is Maintained by me. It's an open source alternative
to Solutions like WHMCS or Tekbase. The System comes with a full featured Stack of Functions, 
a multilevel Permission System, a Plugin System, a Ticketing System and a diverse Theming and 
Designing System. This Project is not for somebody who needs a High secure never have problems -
Panel, only for them who never pay for WHMCS or like open source Projects.

### **Problems: The Panel is not working yet. Its under developement, so never use it - when you're not a Dev :)**

## Features List:
- Open Source, no "**Freemium**".
- You can use it for Personal and Commercial use.
- It's based on Laravel Framework (7). Which is easy extendable and good documented.
- Easy to Setup (need only Webserver and MySQl Database).
- Plugin/Module System - you can write your own Plugins and integrate it easy into Panel.
- Well documented Developer and User Documentation (//TODO).
- Permissions System with Roles + Single extra Set-able Permissions per User/group.
- Backend System for the Controlpanel.
